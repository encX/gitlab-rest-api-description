# GitLab REST API description
OpenAPI/Swagger description for [GitLab REST API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/api_resources.html)  

Inspired by [GitHub's official REST API descption](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description)  
I wanted to make GitLab API more accessible.

This project currently offers OpenAPI 3.0 descriptions.  
So it might be incompatible with some tools.

## Goal
All OpenAPI descriptions in this project were initially generated  
by crawling GitLab's API documentation using [this project](https://github.com/encX/gitlab-api-doc-crawler)

As crawling web pages will never get to 100% accuracy, let alone the coverage.  
These descriptions need lots of contribution to perfect.  
_Contributing guidelines coming soon._

Also, GitLab doesn't have any official API client.  
These API descriptions play important role
as they can be used to generate clients in different languages.

## What is OpenAPI/Swagger description?
You can read [OpenAPI Specification README](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification#readme=)  
or if you are a hardcore reader, you may find [RFC](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html#) interesting.
